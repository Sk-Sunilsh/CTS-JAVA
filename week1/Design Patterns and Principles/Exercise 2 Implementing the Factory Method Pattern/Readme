Purpose:
Defines a common interface for object creation, allowing subclasses to determine the specific type of object to instantiate.

Used In:
FactoryMethodPatternExample.java

Technical Highlights:

Interface: Document with a method like open().

Concrete Classes: WordDocument, PdfDocument, ExcelDocument implement the Document interface.

Factories: WordDocumentFactory, PdfDocumentFactory, ExcelDocumentFactory override the createDocument() method to return specific document types.

Benefits:

Encourages loose coupling between client code and concrete implementations.

Enhances scalability by allowing new document types to be added with minimal changes.

Supports the Open/Closed Principle â€” classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

Makes the code more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to change.
