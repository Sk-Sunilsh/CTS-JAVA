Purpose:
Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to that instance.

Used In:
SingletonPatternExample.java

Technical Highlights:

Implements lazy initialization by creating the instance only when needed.

Uses a private constructor to restrict instantiation from outside the class.

Provides a static method (getInstance()) to access the single instance.

Commonly applied in areas such as logging, configuration management, and database connection handling.

Benefits:

Prevents resource conflicts by maintaining a single shared instance.

Ensures consistent behavior across the application, especially for tasks like logging.

Reduces memory usage by avoiding unnecessary object creation.

Simplifies debugging and maintenance by centralizing control.
