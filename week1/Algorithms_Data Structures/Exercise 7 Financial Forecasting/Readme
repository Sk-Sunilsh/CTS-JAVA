Purpose:
Illustrates both recursive and iterative approaches to compute compound interest over a given time period.

Used In:
FinancialForecasting.java

Technical Highlights:

Recursive method calculates future value through repeated method calls, modeling the compounding process naturally.

Iterative method uses a loop to achieve the same result with better performance and lower memory usage.

Utilizes Java's Scanner for user input and NumberFormat for formatting currency output.

Benefits:

Demonstrates the trade-offs between recursion and iteration in terms of time and space complexity.

Helps in understanding control flow and performance characteristics of different programming techniques.

Applicable to basic financial forecasting, investment simulations, or projecting time-based data growth.

Serves as a foundational example for teaching mathematical modeling in programming.
